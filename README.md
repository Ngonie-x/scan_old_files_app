# scan_old_files_app
A simple app that scans files and returns the ones modified before a specific date. It's purpose is to scan folders for old files that maybe taking up space unnecessarily and delete them if the user prompts.
Often wonder where all the space in my PC is going. I go through my PC only to find a tonne of old files taking up a huge amount of space. This is precisely what this application aims to address. I can easily just scan folders for old files and delete them.
